• For each image, the maximum number of faces detected is 64 and the faces are ranked by face rectangle size in descending order. If no face is detected, an empty array will be returned. 
• Some faces may not be detected due to technical challenges, e.g. very large face angles (head-pose), large occlusion. Frontal and near-frontal faces have the best results.
