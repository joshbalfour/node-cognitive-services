/**
 * The Spell Check API lets you perform contextual grammar and spell checking.
 * 
 * What’s the difference between regular spell-checkers and Bing’s 3rd generation spell-checker? Current spell-checkers rely on verifying spelling and grammar against dictionary-based rule sets, which get updated and expanded periodically. In other words, the spell-checker is only as strong as the dictionary that supports it, and the editorial staff who supports the dictionary. You know this type of spell-checker from Microsoft Word and other word processors.
 * 
 * In contrast, Bing has developed a web-based spell-checker that leverages machine learning and statistical machine translation to dynamically train a constantly evolving and highly contextual algorithm. The spell-checker is based on a massive corpus of web searches and documents.
 * 
    - This spell-checker can handle any word-processing scenario:
    - Recognizes slang and informal language
    - Recognizes common name errors in context
    - Corrects word breaking issues with a single flag
    - Is able to correct homophones in context, and other difficult to spot errors
    - Supports new brands, digital entertainment, and popular expressions as they emerge
    - Words that sound the same but differ in meaning and spelling, for example “see” and “sea.”
