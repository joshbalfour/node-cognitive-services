Video file size should be no larger than 100MB. <br/>\n&bull; The number of scenes displayed in the thumbnail is either chosen by the user or defaults to the optimal duration supported by the Video API’s algorithm.<br/>\n&bull; A scene is a collection of indexed frames. Scenes are mapped according to sequence in video. <br/>\n&bull; Fade in/fade out effects are included in the thumbnail by default, but can be turned off by the user. <br/>\n&bull; Audio is included by default, but can be turned off by the user. Pauses in audio are detected to divide video into coherent scenes and avoid breaking sentences of speech.<br/>\n&bull; Output files are deleted after 24 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Optimal Duration of Video Thumbnail Supported by Video API shown in table below.\n\n<table class=\"element table\">\n<thead>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Motion Thumbnail</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Video duration (d)</td>\n<td>d < 3min</td>\n<td>3min < d < 15min</td>\n<td>15min < d < 30min</td>\n<td>30min < d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thumbnail duration</td>\n<td>15sec (2-3 scenes)</td>\n<td>30sec (3-5 scenes)</td>\n<td>60sec (5-10 scenes)</td>\n<td>90sec (10-15 scenes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tbody>\n</table>",
