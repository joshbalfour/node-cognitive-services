• User can input detection zones to set up as areas to detect motion. 
• User can specify motion sensitivity: high, medium, and low. Higher sensitivity means more motions will be detected at a cost that more false alarms will be reported.
• Motion Detection is optimized for stationary background videos. 
• User can specify whether light change events should be detected. A light change refers to a change in the frame that was caused by a light turning off and on. Some developers do not want to detect this, as they consider it a false alarm. Other developers want to make sure they capture any change, light changes included.
• User can specify whether successive motions should be merged together by passing in a parameter (mergeTimeThreshold) For example, if a motion happens from 1 to 4 seconds and the next motion happens from 5 to 10 seconds, some developers will want to count that as one instance of motion.
• User can specify which frames to be detected by passing in a parameter (frameSamplingValue).
• Some motion may not be detected due to technical challenges; e.g. semi-transparent objects, and some small objects.
