## Description

Unofficial SDK for [Microsoft速 Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services) written for Node.JS.

Usage of Microsoft速 Cognitive Services is bound by their [Terms and Conditions](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/legal/CognitiveServicesTerms20160628.htm).

## Getting Started

To get started first [sign up](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up) and [grab your API keys](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-US/subscriptions).
Then figure out which API you want to use, you can find descriptions [here](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/apis).

To use this SDK in your project, run `npm install --save cognitive-services`.

Then make a JS file in your project directory and add the following:

```javascript
const cognitiveServices = require('cognitive-services');
```

You are now ready to use the APIs, for example:

```javascript
const parameters = {
    "mode": "proof",
    "mkt": "en-us"
}

const body = "Text=Bill+Gatas"

const spellCheckClient = new cognitiveServices.bingSpellCheck({
    apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
    endpoint: "YOUR-ENDPOINT"
})

spellCheckClient.spellCheck({
    parameters,
    body
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response);
})
```

If you want to see more examples of use you can see within the `test` folder.
